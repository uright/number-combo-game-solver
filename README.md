Number combo game solver

Today, my kids came home with a math assignment from Spirit of Math. Given 4 digits 1-9-4-2, add the operations between the digits to result in number 1 through 100. Digits can be combined to form a number say 9 and 4 can form 94. In additional to the +, -, * and / operations, kids can also use power and factorial operations. This became quite a challenge for them. And I would like to write a python program to solve this game.
